CPU Frequency is based on TV signal frequency, either NTSC or PAL depending on
the region.

(Not yet sure if deliberate design to keep CPU and PPU in sync, or if the
crystals are just cheaper...)

NTSC

- 525 scanlines (483 visible)
- Interleaved, so two cycles required to refresh
- Refresh cycle is 60/1.001 Hz
- 227.5 colorburst carrier frequency

So, f = (227.5) * (525 * 60/1.001 / 2)
      = 315 / 88 Mhz
      = 3.579545454... MHz

PAL
- 625 scanlines (576 visible), interleaved
- 50 Hz refresh cycle
- 283.75 colorburst carrier frequency
- Fixed 25 Hz offset to the frequency

So f = (283.75) * (625 * 50 / 2) + 25
     = 4.43361875 MHz

Notes:

- Why 60/1.001?  The original B&W signals were exactly 60Hz, matching AC power
  frequency in the US.  But when color was introduced, it was shifted down to
  "eliminate stationary dot patterns in the difference frequency between sound
  and color carriers".  (see wikipedia)

  (Something to do with the interference between the sound and color carrier
  wave signals...)

- Why 525 scanlines?  This had something to do with vacuum tube multivibrators,
  which were based on divisible ratios within the chains, so the numbers
  usually involved products of low primes.  Interleaved signals also require an
  odd number for some reason  (i.e. no 2's in the prime factorisation).

  To get near the desired 500 scanlines, the chosen NTSC breakdown was

      525 = 3 * 5 * 5 * 7

  For similar reasons, the PAL/SECAM choice was 625 = 5 * 5 * 5 * 5.

- Because of the 25 HZ offset to PAL refresh, the effective colorburst carrier
  frequency is 283.7516, slightly higher than the specification.
